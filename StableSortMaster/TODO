// Just check for sorted, not necessarily stably sorted
X Sort empty array -> empty array
X Sort [1] -> [1]
X Sort [1, 2] -> [1, 2]
X Sort [2, 1] -> [1, 2]
X Sort [0, 1, -1] -> [-1, 0, 1]
X Sort [5, 4, 14] -> [4, 5, 14]
X Sort an array of Integers and not Sortables
X Sortable<String> [c, e, a, r] = [a, c, e, r]
X Make sure all of the previous cases are stably sorted (with the exception of an array of Integers)
X Generate n random tests
X Sorting all same numbers is stable.
