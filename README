This is the starter code for Xiàngqí, a Chines chess game engine.
When you import it into Eclipse you should do the following:
	- Change the project name to XiangqiStudentyyy, where "yyy" is your
	  WPI username.
	- Change the package xiangqi.studentxxx to xiangstudentyyy, just as
	  you change the project name. The xiangqi.studentxxx package is in
	  both the src and test folders.
	- Remove src/xiangqi.studentxxx.package-info.java.
	- Remove test/xiangqi.studentxxx.testpackageinfo.java.
	- Remove this file.
